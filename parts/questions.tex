    \begin{itemize}
      \item
          Beam width ($x$, $y$): $\unit[40]{\mu m}$ for LHCb; what are the widths for ATLAS and CMS?
      \item
          Transverse resolution: $\unit[5\textup{--}15]{\mu m}$ for LHCb depending on number of tracks; what is it for ATLAS and CMS?
      \item
          Longitudinal resolution: $\unit[40\textup{--}100]{\mu m}$ for LHCb depending on number of tracks; what is it for ATLAS and CMS?
      \item
          Cleaning up prototracks based on IP could simplify kernel
      \item
          Can prototracking be done in the ATLAS and CMS triggers?
